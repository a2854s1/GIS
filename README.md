# Summer2020GIS
This is a package showing what GIS-related work I have completed in Summer 2020.

# Introduction to this Package
2020 has been a unique year with COVID-19. Despite the unusual challenging times, I still keep on learning new GIS techniques at home virtually. This page documents my GIS products made during the summer period. Please feel free to take a look and ask me if you have any questions.
