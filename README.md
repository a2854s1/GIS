# GIS
This is a package showing what GIS-related work I have completed in my university life and my after-grad life.

# Recent Updates
2020 has been a unique year with COVID-19. Despite the unusual challenging times, I still keep on learning new GIS techniques at home virtually. This page documents my GIS products made during the summer period. Please feel free to take a look and ask me if you have any questions.

# Work Categories
1. Maps - highlight the key maps that I have been created these few years.
2. GIS Presentations - include all the GIS presentations I used to help GIS beginners to more easily understand GIS concepts.
