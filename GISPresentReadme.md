# Introduction
This is a collection of my GIS presentations created in Summer 2020 for helping GIS beginners to better understand GIS concepts in simple terms.
The slides are mainly written in English with some Traditional Chinese translations for Chinese students who have difficulty in understanding the GIS terms.
